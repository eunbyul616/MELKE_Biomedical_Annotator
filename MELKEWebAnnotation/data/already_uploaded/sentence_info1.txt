NCT00140166|NCT001401660|Treatment of Acute Schizophrenia With Vitamin Therapy. amin Therapy	Brief Summary : Controlled studies using the orthomolecular approach have been few (Deutsch, Ananth, & Ban, 1977).
NCT00140166|NCT001401661|Those that were done were performed in chronic schizophrenia or in populations that included bipolar and schizoaffective patients.
NCT00140166|NCT001401662|Both of these diagnostic groups are not today considered to benefit from the orthomolecular approach.
NCT00140166|NCT001401663|Moreover, some negative studies of high-dose niacin were done in patients who were not otherwise given general counseling for good diet as described above.
NCT00140166|NCT001401664|Therefore, this proposal is to study in a controlled manner carefully defined first onset schizophrenic patients using the protocol advocated by Osmond and Hoffer (1962).
NCT00140166|NCT001401665|Patients can enter the study if they have been ill less than 1 year and are in their first hospitalization.

NCT00140166|NCT001401667|Those that were done were performed in chronic schizophrenia or in populations that included bipolar and schizoaffective patients.
NCT00140166|NCT001401668|Both of these diagnostic groups are not today considered to benefit from the orthomolecular approach.
NCT00140166|NCT001401669|Moreover, some negative studies of high-dose niacin were done in patients who were not otherwise given general counseling for good diet as described above.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016610|Therefore, this proposal is to study in a controlled manner carefully defined first onset schizophrenic patients using the protocol advocated by Osmond and Hoffer (1962).
NCT00140166|NCT0014016611|Patients can enter the study if they have been ill less than 1 year and are in their first hospitalization.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016612|Our Beersheba Mental Health Center is the only hospitalization facility for Southern Israel, population of half a million.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016613|There about 2 thousand admissions to our hospital yearly and of those there are over 100 admissions with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder for whom this is the first lifetime admission to hospital and their first episode of psychosis.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016614|Methods Study I - Open Pilot The pilot study will be carried out exactly as below, except without a control group.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016615|Results from the pilot will be evaluated before continuing to the controlled study, and protocol modifications presented to the Helsinki Committee if necessary.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016616|Ten patients will be studied in this open pilot study.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016617|Study II - Controlled Study, Not Blind Inclusion and exclusion criteria Patients can be accepted to the study age 18-30, if admitting diagnosis after review by the study coordinator is schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder by DSM-IV.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016618|Since the diagnosis of schizophrenia may be difficult in the early stages of acute psychotic disease, cases in which the clinical diagnosis is consistent with and suspicious of schizophrenia (and inconsistent with bipolar disorder) even if they do not fulfill all the diagnostic criteria in DSM-IV will be accepted.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016619|Patients with alcohol or drug abuse in the last 6 months will be excluded.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016620|Patients with significant physical illness including peptic ulcer, or a history of hepatitis or baseline abnormal liver function tests will be excluded.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016621|Patients with mental retardation will be excluded.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016622|Baseline screening will be done for liver function (including AST, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and LDH) and blood glucose and then repeated after 6 weeks.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016623|Elevations of AST over three fold will lead to dropping patient from study.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016624|Patients who are unlikely to be able to continue in the study as outpatients will be excluded.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016625|Patients will be admitted to study only if this is their first lifetime psychiatric admission and their first episode of psychosis and only if history supports that they have been mentally ill for less than one year.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016626|Procedure Patients who enter the program will be treated with risperidone, 2-8mg daily at physician's discretion .
NCT00140166|NCT0014016627|They will be randomized according to a predetermined random order to vitamin regime or Centrum forte.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016628|Doses of risperidone will be lowered as clinically possible.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016629|Risperidone dose will be recorded weekly and will serve as a secondary outcome measure.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016630|A registered dietician will meet with each patient weekly and discourage refined sugar or excess fat and encourage regular fruit and vegetable consumption.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016631|High protein breakfast will be emphasized.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016632|Fifteen patients will be started yearly for three years.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016633|The vitamin regimen will be as follows twice daily with food:   1.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016634|Ascorbic acid 1.5 g twice daily.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016635|2.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016636|150 mg vitamin B6 twice daily   3.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016637|Niacinamide 500 mg tablets, 3 tablets (1.5g) twice daily with food.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016638|4.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016639|Centrum Forte, one tablet each morning with food.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016640|The comparison group will receive Centrum Forte once per day.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016641|Outcome measures Patients will be rated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) at baseline and weekly for 6 months.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016642|All patients will receive supportive psychotherapy both during the hospitalization and in clinic follow-up.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016643|Discharged patients will be followed in the outpatient clinic of the Beersheba Mental Health Center by a physician plus dietician team dedicated to this study.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016644|Each patient will be followed for six months.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016645|Outcome measures will be BPRS ratings over the course of the half year, readmissions, Global Clinical Assessment of function at the end of the half year, and risperidone dose.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016646|Skin test A blunted response of dermal erythema to niacin has been widely reported in schizophrenia, and it is possible that this response might predict clinical response to niacin treatment.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016647|All patients will have the Horrobin niacin patch test (Smesny et al., 2003) on admission to the study and it will be repeated after 6 months of continuous therapy.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016648|Niacin is applied simultaneously in four dilutions (0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001M) of 50microl each (approximately one drop of a standard eye-dropper) to the skin at the inner side of the forearm using chambered plaster for epicutaneous testing.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016649|After 90 seconds the plaster is removed.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016650|Skin reaction is quantitated at 3 minute intervals up to 21 minutes starting 90 seconds after removal of the plaster.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016651|Risks The risks of high dose ascorbic acid have been reviewed extensively but these refer to doses such as 10g daily and the present dose of 3g daily is associated with minimal risk eg diarrhea.
NCT00140166|NCT0014016652|Doses greater than 3gm daily can cause increases in ALT and uric acid but risk of kidney stones has not been substantiated (Russel, 2005).
NCT00140166|NCT0014016653|Niacin at 3g daily is now widely used as a cholesterol lowering agent (Alpers, Stenson, & Bier, 2002) and is associated with minimal side effects or dangers eg, up to 5% increased glucose, elevations of liver enzymes and exacerbation in peptic ulcer, but these effects are rarely if ever seen with the derivative nicotinamide (Guyton, 2005).
NCT00140166|NCT0014016654|The other B-vitamins in the doses given would not be associated with any side effects.

NCT00140179|NCT001401790|Valnoctamide in Mania. ide in Mania	Brief Summary : Valproic acid is a leading mood stabilizer for the treatment of bipolar disorder.
NCT00140179|NCT001401791|Its well-known teratogenicity limits its use in young women of childbearing age.
NCT00140179|NCT001401792|According to toxicologic studies the teratogenicity of valproate stems from its free carboxylic group.
NCT00140179|NCT001401793|Valnoctamide is an isomer and an analog of valpromide.
NCT00140179|NCT001401794|Unlike valpromide, valnoctamide does not undergo a biotransformation to the corresponding free acid.
NCT00140179|NCT001401795|It is also likely or at least possible that valnoctamide is bipolar.
NCT00140179|NCT001401796|In mice valnoctamide has been shown to be distinctly less teratogenic than valproate.
NCT00140179|NCT001401797|An injection at day 8 of gestation produced only 1% exencephaly (as compared to 0-1% in control mice and 53% in valproate treated mice).
NCT00140179|NCT001401798|The investigators are performing a double-blind controlled trial of valnoctamide as an bipolar drug.
NCT00140179|NCT001401799|If shown to be bipolar, valnoctamide could be an important valproate substitute for young women with bipolar disorder who are at risk of pregnancy.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017910|Patients newly admitted to the Beersheva Mental Health Center may participate if they meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for mania or schizoaffective disorder, manic type.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017911|Patients admitted to the study are treated with risperidone at doses of the physicians' discretion beginning with 2 mg daily on days 1 and 2.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017912|Valnoctamide or placebo is begun at doses of 600 mg per day (200 mg three times daily) and increased to 1200 mg (400 mg three times daily) after four days.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017913|Weekly ratings by a psychiatrist blind to the study drug are conducted using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017914|Weekly blood is drawn for drug levels of valnoctamide to be measured by gas chromatography.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017915|Each patient receives valnoctamide or placebo for 5 weeks.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017916|Low teratogenic mood stabilizers are a high priority for current research.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017917|Condition or disease : 'Mania'	Intervention/treatment : 'Drug valnoctamide'	Phase : 'Phase 3'	Detailed Description : Valproic acid is a leading mood stabilizer for the treatment of bipolar disorder.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017918|Its well-known teratogenicity limits its use in young women of childbearing age (1-3).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017919|The alternative mood stabilizers such as lithium and carbamazepine also have teratogenic potential so the treatment of bipolar disorder in young women is problematic.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017920|The difficulties are particularly acute in those young women patients who respond well to bipolar therapy and maintain or begin normal interpersonal and marital relations and desire to have children.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017921|One approach to this problem has been the search for valproic acid derivatives with less teratogenic potential (4).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017922|According to toxicologic studies the teratogenicity of valproate stems from its free carboxylic group (2, 3).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017923|Valpromide is an amide derivative of valproate without the suspect free carboxylic group.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017924|It was synthesized and marketed and has anticonvulsant efficacy, at least as good as valproic acid (1).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017925|There are some reports of its efficacy in bipolar disorder as well (5).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017926|In some animal species, only a small amount of valpromide is metabolized to valproic acid.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017927|However, in humans valpromide is metabolized to a large degree to valproic acid and so it does not solve the problem of teratogenicity (1, 6).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017928|Valnoctamide is an isomer and an analog of valpromide.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017929|Unlike valpromide, valnoctamide does not undergo biotransformation to the corresponding free acid (6-9).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017930|In animal studies it is at least as anticonvulsant as valproate and valpromide (1, 6, 10).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017931|It has been marketed as an anxiolytic and sedative in several European countries (as Nirvanil) including Italy, Holland and Switzerland but has not actively been promoted as an anticonvulsant.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017932|It was marketed in the USA as Axiquel by McNeil in the 1970/'s.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017933|Unfortunately, despite considerable efforts we have not been able to obtain pharmacovigilance data from this period.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017934|Given its equivalence to valproate and valpromide as an anticonvulsant in animal models of epilepsy (1, 6, 10), it is reasonable to assume that valnoctamide is also anticonvulsant in humans.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017935|It is also likely or at least possible that valnoctamide is bipolar.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017936|In mice valnoctamide has been shown to be distinctly less teratogenic than valproate (11).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017937|Injection at day 8 of gestation produced only 1percent exencephaly (as compared to 0-1percent in control mice and 53 percent in valproate treated mice).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017938|Embryolethality rates showed similar results: 52 percent with valproate vs. 5percent in the controls and 2 percent with valnoctamide.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017939|Valnoctamide/'s patent is expired (12) and it is not the property of any major pharmaceutical company.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017940|Pharmaceutical company support cannot be obtained for our trial; therefore it is investigator initiated.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017941|Valnoctamide will be synthesized for our study by Banyan Chemical in India (which has been inspected by the FDA) by GLP (good laboratory practice) in a manner acceptable for human use by the Israel Ministry of Health (and in principle for an IND by the FDA).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017942|Banyan manufactures at the same site generic compounds, atenolol for instance, sold in the USA and distributed by international companies, Novartis for instance.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017943|Study Design: The study has been submitted to our Helsinki Committee and only patients who give informed written consent will be accepted.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017944|Patients newly admitted to the Beersheva Mental Health Center may participate if they meet DSM-IV criteria for mania or schizoaffective disorder, manic type.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017945|Minimal Young Mania Scale = 20.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017946|Only patients admitted to the hospital within the previous 72 hours will be eligible for the study.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017947|Exclusion criteria will be as in previous studies of mania with this design by our group (15-17) and will include drug abuse, active physical illness, and of course pregnancy.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017948|Patients admitted to the study will be treated with risperidone at doses of physicians/' discretion beginning with 2 mg daily on days 1 and 2.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017949|On days 3 and 4 the risperidone dose could be increased to a maximum of 4 mg daily or decreased to 1mg daily.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017950|On days 5 to study end the dose could be increased to a maximum of 6 mg daily or decreased to a minimum of 1mg (see ref #18).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017951|Dose of risperidone will be a secondary outcome measure (see reference #15 & #16).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017952|No washout from previous medication is required but patients who received depot neuroleptics within the past 2 weeks or more than 300 mg of chlorpromazine equivalents in the past three days will be excluded.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017953|Trihexyphenidyl (up to 4 mg daily) will be available as necessary for extrapyramidal symptoms and benzodiazepines for sleep.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017954|Valnoctamide or placebo will be begun at doses of 600 mg per day (200 mg three times daily) and increased to 1200 mg (400 mg three times daily) after four days.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017955|This dose is based on relative anticonvulsant effects of valproate and valnoctamide in animal studies (1, 6, 10).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017956|Patients will receive valnoctamide or identical capsules of placebo as assigned by the control psychiatrist according to random order; manic and schizoaffective manic patients will be randomized separately.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017957|Weekly ratings by a psychiatrist blind to the study drug will be conducted using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017958|Primary outcome measure will be BPRS.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017959|Weekly blood will be drawn for drug levels of valnoctamide to be measured by gas chromatography (19).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017960|Each patient will receive valnoctamide or placebo for 5 weeks.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017961|Power Analysis: We have demonstrated significant effects as add-on in mania in this design with lithium (15), carbamazepine (16), and phenytoin (17).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017962|Each study had an N of about 40 patients, recruited over 18 months in each study.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017963|In each study as in the present proposal, a mood stabilizer or potential mood stabilizer was added to haloperidol at doses of physician/'s discretion for five weeks.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017964|Lithium adds clinically and statistically significant benefit to haloperidol treatment of mania (15) as does carbamazepine (16) and phenytoin (17).
NCT00140179|NCT0014017965|Such an add-on design is consistent with clinical practice and makes sense since dopamine blockers and mood stabilizers probably work by different mechanisms in mania.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017966|Valproate is typically used clinically in acute mania as an add-on to neuroleptics as well.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017967|Three positive studies published in excellent journals (15-17) from our group using this design are probably better than formal power analysis, which depends on a range of assumptions that are collapsible into the experience of our three studies.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017968|Because the prior probability of an effect of valnoctamide is lower than that of the above well-known compounds, we suggest recruitment of 80 patients over 36 months to adequately power this study rather than the 40 patients in each of our previous studies.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017969|Since valnoctamide is no longer patented, orphan drug procedures or a use patent of the type granted to Abbott for divalproex sodium will be necessary to make this drug available for bipolar patients at risk for pregnancy in the future.
NCT00140179|NCT0014017970|An adequately powered study is therefore important at this stage.

NCT00140192|NCT001401920|Creatine Treatment in Psychiatric Disorders. ic Disorders	Brief Summary : Creatine plays a pivotal role in brain energy homeostasis.
NCT00140192|NCT001401921|Creatine supplementation is widely used in enhancing sports performance, and has been tried in the treatment of neurological, neuromuscular and atherosclerotic disease with a paucity of side effects.
NCT00140192|NCT001401922|Dechent et al (1999) studied the effect of oral creatine supplementation for 4 wk demonstrating a statistically significant increase of mean concentration of total creatine across brain regions.
NCT00140192|NCT001401923|These findings suggest the possibility of using oral creatine supplementation to modify brain high-energy phosphate metabolism in subjects with various brain disorders, including schizophrenia and major depression.
NCT00140192|NCT001401924|Recently, Rae et al (2003) reported that creatine supplementation for 6 weeks had a significant positive effect on both working memory and Raven matrices.
NCT00140192|NCT001401925|Several independent lines of evidence suggest the possible involvement of altered cerebral energy metabolism in schizophrenia.
NCT00140192|NCT001401926|We are performing a double blind cross-over study of creatine in schizophrenia.
NCT00140192|NCT001401927|Forty patients will be treated with creatine for 3 months in a double-blind crossover design.
NCT00140192|NCT001401928|Rating scales will include scales for assessing negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, clinical global impressions scale, scales for side-effects and a cognitive battery Creatine effects on brain energy metabolism and its possible cognitive enhancing properties raise the possibility of developing a new therapeutic strategy in schizophrenia focusing on treating metabolic hypoactive brain areas including frontal regions.
NCT00140192|NCT001401929|Condition or disease : 'Schizophrenia'	Intervention/treatment : 'Drug creatine'	Phase : 'Phase 3'	Detailed Description : Creatine plays a pivotal role in brain energy homeostasis, being a temporal and spatial buffer for cytosolic and mitochondrial pools of the cellular energy currency adenosine triphosphate (Wyss & Kaddurah-Daouk, 2000).
NCT00140192|NCT0014019210|Recent studies have suggested increased brain utilization of oxygen following oral creatine supplementation (Persky & Brazeua, 2001).
NCT00140192|NCT0014019211|Creatine supplementation is widely used in enhancing sports performance, and has been tried in the treatment of neurological, neuromuscular and atherosclerotic disease with a paucity of side effects (Persky & Brazeua, 2001).
NCT00140192|NCT0014019212|Creatine enters the brain via a specialized sodium dependent transporter.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019213|Dechent et al (1999) studied the effect of oral creatine supplementation of 20g/day for 4 wk demonstrating a significant increase of mean concentration of total creatine across brain regions (8.7% corresponding to 0.6mM, P < 0.001).
NCT00140192|NCT0014019214|Lyoo et al (2003) studied magnetic resonance spectroscopy of high-energy phosphate metabolites in human brain following oral supplementation of creatine reporting that creatine (0.3 g/kg/day for the first 7 days and 0.03 g/kg/day for the next 7 days) significantly increased brain creatine levels.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019215|These findings suggest the possibility of using oral creatine supplementation to modify brain high-energy phosphate metabolism in subjects with various brain disorders, including schizophrenia and major depression, where alterations in brain high-energy phosphate metabolism have been reported.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019216|Kieburtz et al (see: http:/www.huntington-study-group.org/Creatine%20abstract.htm) are conducting a double blind clinical trial of creatine in 50 ambulatory Huntington disease subjects randomized to creatine or placebo.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019217|Those randomized to creatine receive 3g for 2 months and then 5g for an additional 2 months.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019218|There have been no significant adverse events associated with creatine or significant changes in laboratory tests or vital signs.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019219|In the creatine treated group creatine plasma levels approximately doubled (210 ± 335 µM vs. 500 ± 125 µM).
NCT00140192|NCT0014019220|Kieburtz et al are currently also conducting a multi-center, double-blind study of creatine in patients with Parkinson's disease, funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).
NCT00140192|NCT0014019221|Recently, Rae et al (2003) reported that creatine supplementation (5 grams per day for 6 weeks) had a significant positive effect (p < 0.0001) on both working memory (backward digit span) and Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019222|These findings suggest a role of brain energy capacity in influencing brain cognitive performance and that creatine via its effects on brain energy metabolism may exert beneficial effects on cognition.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019223|Several independent lines of evidence suggest the possible involvement of altered cerebral energy metabolism in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019224|Imaging studies have used positron emission tomography (PET) with flurodeoxyglucose (FDG), or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 15O magnetic resonance spectroscopy with 31P (31P-MRS) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT), to investigate cerebral metabolic rates in schizophrenia.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019225|Most but not all studies reveal decreased metabolism in the frontal cortex in schizophrenia, which was termed hypofrontality.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019226|Several studies also observed alterations in brain metabolic rates in other brain regions including the temporal lobes, the thalamus and the basal ganglia, leading to the suggestion of an impairment in the fronto-striatal-thalamic circuitry in schizophrenia rather than in a specific brain region (Andreasen et al. 1997).
NCT00140192|NCT0014019227|A direct link to phosphocreatine and ATP energy systems came from studies using 31P-MRS with or without chemical shift imaging, which enabled the measurement of ATP, phosphocreatine and inorganic phosphate.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019228|These studies showed reduced ATP in the frontal lobe and in left temporal lobe of schizophrenic patients as compared to controls (Volz et al. 2000).
NCT00140192|NCT0014019229|Altered brain energy metabolism could be due to impairment of mitochondria and a variety of studies reviewed recently by Ben Shachar (2002) suggest impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism in schizophrenia.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019230|Interestingly, creatine besides its energy sparing properties was also shown to have neuroprotective properties in a variety of animal models for brain diseases including Huntington and Parkinson diseases, as well as exerting protective effects in animal models for cerebral hypoxia (Persky & Brazeua, 2001).
NCT00140192|NCT0014019231|We are performing a double blind cross-over study of creatine in schizophrenia.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019232|Forty consenting schizophrenic patients, 18-60 years old, physically healthy, with more than 2 years of illness in a stable condition (no gross changes in clinical presentation in the last 6 months as judged by the patient's psychiatrist) and presenting negative and cognitive symptoms (as judged by the patient's psychiatrist along with score in at least 3 items of the PANSS negative subscale =4 points, while items of the PANSS positive subscale scored = 3 points).
NCT00140192|NCT0014019233|These patients will be recruited into the study over two years.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019234|Excluded will be patients with alcohol or drug abuse in the 6 months prior to entry into the study or any clinically significant medical condition or laboratory abnormality.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019235|Twenty patients will be treated with creatine for 3 months (3 g daily in the first month and then 5 g daily for another 2 months) and then for 3 months with placebo.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019236|The other twenty patients will be administered placebo for 3 months and then creatine for 3 months in the same dosages and procedure.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019237|Patients' neuroleptic treatment will not be affected by study participation.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019238|Mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines and anticholinergic medications are allowed but doses will be documented throughout the study.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019239|Routine blood tests including kidney function, liver function as well as plasma creatine and creatinine will be monitored at baseline and monthly throughout the study.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019240|Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), and Adverse effect/side effects assessment will be administered at baseline and then monthly.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019241|A Cognitive Battery will be administered at baseline, three months, and six months consisting of the California Verbal Learning Test; Trail making A&B; Purdue Pegboard; Digit Symbol Coding; Continuous performance test ; Reaction Time performance Test and Wisconsin Card Sort Test.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019242|Power Analysis: We have demonstrated significant effects as add-on in schizophrenia in this design with folate treatment as a homocysteine lowering strategy in schizophrenia.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019243|A sample of 36 subjects recruited over 24 months showed a statistically significant, clinically relevant difference between the active treatment and placebo in a similar design to that proposed here.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019244|Creatine administration is safe with a paucity of side effects.
NCT00140192|NCT0014019245|Creatine effects on brain energy metabolism and its possible cognitive enhancing properties raise the possibility of developing a new therapeutic strategy in schizophrenia focusing on treating metabolic and energetic hypoactive brain areas including frontal regions.

NCT00140244|NCT001402441|Condition or disease : 'HAART Lipodystrophy and Metabolic Syndrome'	Intervention/treatment : 'Drug r-metHuLeptin r-MetHuLeptin'	Phase : 'Phase 2'	Detailed Description : Exposure to HIV medications has been associated with metabolic changes including generalized fat depletion (lipoatrophy), high triglyceride levels, and in some patients, high sugar levels or diabetes.
NCT00140244|NCT001402442|This syndrome is associated with a deficiency of leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells.
NCT00140244|NCT001402443|Recent studies involving leptin administration to patients with congenital lipoatrophy have shown dramatic improvements in metabolic parameters such as insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia.
NCT00140244|NCT001402444|Leptin administration to patients with HAART lipoatrophy may also lead to significant improvements in the metabolic abnormalities found in these HIV+ patients.

NCT00140257|NCT001402570|DECARD: Study of Escitalopram in the Prevention of Depression in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome. ary Syndrome	Brief Summary : Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of preventive treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (escitalopram) in the first year after acute coronary syndromes (ACS).
NCT00140257|NCT001402571|Methods: 240 patients with acute coronary syndromes (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]), STEMI or unstable angina) will be enrolled within 8 weeks after ACS and will be randomly assigned to treatment with escitalopram/placebo (5-20 mg) in 52 weeks.
NCT00140257|NCT001402572|Primary outcome measures are the diagnosis of depression and HDS (Hamilton Depression Scale).
NCT00140257|NCT001402573|Psychiatric measurements: SCAN (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry), HDS, HAS (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale, ESSI (Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease [ENRICHD] Social Support Instrument), SF-36 (Short Form-36 Health Survey), SCL-92 (Symptom Check List) and BDI (Beck´s Depression Inventory).
NCT00140257|NCT001402574|Cardiological measurements are blood pressure, electrocardiography, echocardiography (left ventricular ejection fraction), heart rate variability and use of medicine.
NCT00140257|NCT001402575|Discussion: ACS patients with mental illness are usually only diagnosed to a very small extent during admission in a cardiologic department.
NCT00140257|NCT001402576|These patients mainly remain untreated with an increased risk of somatic comorbidity and mortality.
NCT00140257|NCT001402577|Therefore, it is in accordance with ethical principles to conduct a double blind, placebo-controlled study investigating the interface between anxiety, depression and ACS.
NCT00140257|NCT001402578|Even in this blinded study, where one of the groups are treated with placebo, there will be a higher degree of treatment of depressive symptoms due to the low recognition of this problem.
NCT00140257|NCT001402579|Conclusion: The DECARD study is the first study evaluating the effect of prophylactic treatment of depression in patients with ACS.
NCT00140257|NCT0014025710|The study will show if prophylactic treatment will improve cardiac prognosis.
